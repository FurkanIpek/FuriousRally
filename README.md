# FuriousRally
Computer Graphics Course Project

	Furious Rally is a car race with a fixed map. I will implement the following features:
•	Collision detection -> If cars hit each other or walls, situation should be handled properly.
•	Procedural modeling -> Will be used to simulate exhaust smoke, fire & cloud to make game environment richer.
	A sample image from another game: 
	Brief information about the game features:
•	There will be fixed amount of competitors, computer-controlled cars. If user wins the race, becomes the 1st one to finish the race, elapsed time will be recorded for user to compete with him/herself as well.
•	User's car will be on complete control of user, i.e. car won't hit the road if user won't command it to.
•	When cars go off the road, their speed will decrease & in some point there will be walls for preventing user from losing the road.
•	On the road, there will be randomly appearing items which increases/decreases the performance of the cars which pick those items up, temporarily.
•	I will also increase the map count if it is feasible, fixed map is just an insight.
